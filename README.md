PowOSh is an open source web application aiming to help people sharing books with their friends. After signing in with your facebook account, you can in a few clicks:

- Upload one of your favourite books
- check what are the latest books that have been made available to share by your friends
- Look for a book you would like to read within all your friend's libraries
- Track all the books you have lended, borrowed or that are available to lend in your library
- Accept/Reject a request from a friend to borrow one of your book
- Mark a book as returned 

We want to share our love for reading with everybody. That is why we want this project to be open source. So please use it, test it, and come back to us with your feedbacks and suggestions.

If you like to use the app and would like to help us improving it we already have a lot of features in mind so please contact us at powosh@gmail.com.
